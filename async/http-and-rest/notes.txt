How the web works:
    -You (client) send HTTP request to Twitter (server) which sends 
     HTTP response back to you.
    -Server is connected to database (tweets, pictures, comments)

HTTP:   
    -Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
    -A set of rules that all clients and servers have to follow

    -Request Method Types: CRUD
        POST -> (Create)
        GET -> (Read)
        PUT -> (Update)
        DELETE -> (Delete)

API:

API on the Web:
    -We create an API on the server side
    -Client makes requests to the server using this API
    -Server reads the request and talks to the database,
     gets data, and sends response back to client
